# Task 2 - Report summarizing changes made

## Approach

1. Set up environment.
1. Remove unused code.
1. Build and run project.
1. Add test coverage based on explicit and inferred requirements.
    - Note: adding test coverage based on *inferred* requirements is not standard practice, but falls within the scope of this coding assignment. In a "real-world" setting, I would seek out requirements clarification from the relevant stakeholders/delegates (e.g. Product Owner, Test Specialist) before adding non-obvious/ambiguous test cases.
1. Red-Green-Refactor.
1. Repeat "Red-Green-Refactor" until satisfied.
1. Identify and implement helpful additive changes (not necessarily new functionality, but including scaling improvements, maintenance improvements, etc. which do not fall under "refactoring" category.)
1. Repeat "Red-Green-Refactor" until satisfied.
1. Identify and implement useful improvements potentially adding new functionality.
1. Repeat "Red-Green-Refactor" until satisfied.
1. Review code deployability.
1. Manual testing/review.
1. Finalize solution and create pull request.
